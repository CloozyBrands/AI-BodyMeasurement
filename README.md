# AI-Powered Body Measurement & Apparel Sizing  

This project is a FastAPI-based application that predicts **body measurements** and **recommends clothing sizes** using deep learning.  
It processes **front and side images**, removes backgrounds, and utilizes a trained **Keras model** for accurate predictions.  

---

## 📌 Features  
✅ **AI-powered body measurement estimation** using images.  
✅ **Automatic background removal** for clean image processing.  
✅ **Deep learning-based predictions** using a trained model.  
✅ **FastAPI integration** for quick and efficient API responses.
